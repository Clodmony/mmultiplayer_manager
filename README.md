## **WARNING: Use at Your Own Risk**

Unfortunately, I did not verify the legitimacy of the executable file before creating the script, and during testing, my antivirus raised concerns about the executable. 
While I believe the file is safe, I cannot guarantee it won't harm your computer. **Use the executable at your own risk**. I am not responsible for any potential damage it may cause to your computer.

**I could read the code of the exe and verifiy it but since i dont know the language and it would only help me i will just abandon the idea of Mirrors Edge Multiplayer.**
